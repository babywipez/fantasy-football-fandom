                <h2>What Is Fantasy Football?</h2>
                <p>Fantasy football traces its roots back to the early 1960s and has been rapidly gaining popularity 
                    since. The idea of fantasy football was created in 1962 by Wilfred "Bill" Winkenbach, an 
                    Oakland, California businessman and limited partner in the Oakland Raiders. He gathered with 7 other 
                    football enthusiasts in a New York hotel room and created what would be the very first fantasy 
                    football league, along with its rules. The rest, as they say, is history.<br><br></p>

                    The premise of fantasy football is that a group of people will each simulate owning their own 
                    football team. The players in the league will either all gather at a predetermined location & time, 
                    or they can meet virtually, and they "draft" their team using players that are active in the NFL.<br><br>The 
                    draft can operate in a variety of ways (order, number of rounds, etc.), but the basic idea is to mimic 
                    the roster of a NFL team. That usually means each team would need a Quarterback, 1 or more Running Backs, 
                    1 or more Wide Receivers, 1 or more Tight Ends, a Kicker, and a Defense. Once the draft is complete, 
                    the teams will play against each other each week of the NFL season using the players they drafted. At the 
                    end of the season, a champion is crowned.<br><br>

                    Fantasy football has changed substantially over the years. When Winkenbach's league was playing, 
                    every stat, score, and point had to be tracked using paper and pen. Now, there are hundreds of 
                    websites and apps that make it easier and more convenient than ever to bring the game to the user.<br><br>

                <h2>Some Valuable Terms</h2>
                <p>
                    Like most hobbies, fantasy football includes its own unique words and phrases. If you're unfamiliar with 
                    the hobby, these can initially sound like gibberish. I've included a few popular terms that fantasy 
                    players often use.
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>PPR</dt>
                    <dd>Point Per Reception - this means that a player scores 1 point every time they catch a pass. Some 
                        leagues may also award half a point per reception (Half PPR) or other variations.

                    <dd>These positions are used as a flexible way of putting different NFL positions into one roster spot. For 
                        example, you can usually play either a wide receiver or running back in a FLEX roster spot.

                <h2>Fantasy Football In 2023</h2>
                <p>
                    In this era of sports, it's hard to turn on a tv, podcast, or any media source without hearing about 
                    sports betting. It's wildly popular and controversial, especially in the United States. Many people may 
                    be hesitant to try fantasy football because of this. While many fantasy leagues do a "buy-in" (an initial 
                    amount of money that each player must contribute into a prize pool prior to the draft), many do not. There 
                    are a variety of ways to enjoy fantasy football, and most of them don't actually revolve around making money.<br><br>
                    My hope with this website is to share insight and viewpoints to help fantasy football grow and be enjoyed 
                    by as many people as possible. Click <a href="whyshould/whyshould.html">here</a> to learn more about why I think 
                    you should be the next person to join or start a fantasy football league!
