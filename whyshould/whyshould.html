            <h1>Why Play Fantasy Football?</h1>
            <p>
                This is a great question and an important one to answer on my quest to spread fantasy football. I 
                believe there are many misconceptions out there about fantasy football and the mindset that leagues 
                and players have about the NFL. I hope to share some of my experience in a way that's helpful for 
                people that may not know much about <em>why</em> people play year after year.
            </p>

            <h2>Helping People Reconnect</h2>
            <figure class="friends-picture">
                <img src="../images/friends.jpg" alt="friends wearing football jerseys">
                <figcaption>Me and some friends after an exciting fantasy draft</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Over the years, I've had the privilege of playing fantasy football with lots of people in lots of 
                leagues. Some leagues had overlap between them, but many did not. Every year, entire different friends groups, 
                friends of friends, strangers, and everyone else merge together in an attempt to win a championship.<br>
                Finding out someone you know plays fantasy football can be a game changer in your relationship with them. 
                You'll find yourself texting them trade offers, laughing about an amazing win or terrible loss, sharing 
                frustration about a team's performance, and much more. My brother lives in a different state, and we did not 
                keep in touch as much as I would have liked over the years. After casually mentioning that I played fantasy 
                football, he immediately asked to start a new league with him. Not only that, but several people we both knew 
                joined. Now, it feels like we're all a small family, and I talk with my brother weekly about the league.<br><br>
                Though this exact example isn't guaranteed to work for everyone, I promise you'll be building friendships and 
                reconnecting with people you'd never expect to through this hobby. It will surprise you!
            </p>

            <h2>Reinforcing Team Allegiance</h2>

                <figcaption>A picture I took in Lambeau Stadium, home of the Green Bay Packers</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                If you're already a fan of a NFL team, then you're doing yourself a disservice by not playing fantasy and 
                drafting one of that team's players. Nothing in the world feels better than watching your favorite wide 
                receiver or running back go nuclear on a particular week, winning you both a NFL game and a fantasy game. It 
                will make the season all the more sweeter and enjoyable of an experience.<br><br>
                If, however, you are not a fan of a NFL team, it is quite likely that you'll develop an allegiance to a team 
                after playing a season or two of fantasy. You'll discover watching certain players is enthralling. Watching them 
                cut in and out of routes, throw beautiful hail marys, catch a deep passes, or power their way through defenders 
                will start to make your jaw drop. It's then that you'll pull the wallet out and grab yourself a jersey. Go team! 
            </p>
            <p class="line-break"></p>
            <h2>Humanizing NFL Players</h2>
            <p>
                This is possibly the biggest misconception within fantasy football and the NFL. The brutal reality of the NFL 
                is that it's a very dangerous and injury-prone contact sport. Players get hurt every week, and oftentimes it can 
                be extremely serious. The media outlets, teams, and the NFLPA (Player's Association) are responsible for coverage   
                and informing the public on these injuries, but the response from the public can be apathetic and even dehumanizing.<br><br>
                By being tuned into the NFL on a weekly, or even daily basis, fantasy football players are almost always 
                more aware of these injuries. That awareness is extremely important to make sure that the NFL 
                is adopting protocols that keep players safe.
            </p>
            <p class="line-break"></p>
            <h2>It's Fun!</h2>
            <p>
                I suppose this one should be incredibly obvious, but playing fantasy football is incredibly fun! Drafting your team, 
                learning which players are poised to have a good game, which defenses are tough, picking your starting roster each week, 
                etc. make this game truly amazing. Winning 1st place in a league is a joy that is impossible to describe but unbelievably
                amazing! 
            </p>
            <p class="line-break"></p>
            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
                I hope that I've been able to do our great hobby a justice by writing this list. Maybe those reading still won't 
                be interested at all in playing fantasy football - and, that's okay! I simply want those people that have never played 
                to get a glimpse into this hobby so that they can better understand the appeal.<br><br>

                resources that are incredibly valuable when playing fantasy football.<br><br>
