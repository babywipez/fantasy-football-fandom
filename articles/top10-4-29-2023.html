            <br>
            <p>
                <b>#1 - Bijan Robinson (RB)</b> - Atlanta Falcons<br>
                A surprise to absolutely nobody, Bijan Robinson sits comfortably at the top of my top 10 fantasy prospects from this year's draft. Averaging a monstrous 
                6.1 yards per carry in 2022, Bijan dominated at the collegiate level and built an incredible resume. Many scouts consider him to be the best prospect 
                since Saquon Barkley, and it's easy to see why when you watch him play.<br><br>
                Another huge plus for Bijan is his draft capital, going to the Falcons at #8 overall. Combine that with Arthur Smith effectively wanting to run the ball 
                exclusively, and it's hard to find a scenario where Bijan <em>doesn't</em> dominate at the next level. He should be the 1.01 in dynasty leagues, and I'll 
                have him as a first round pick in redraft, as well.<br><br>
                <b>#2 - Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)</b> - Detroit Lions<br>
                One of the more head-scratching picks of the first round, Jahmyr Gibbs lands in Detroit after an impressive year at Alabama. Gibbs is an extraordinary
                pass catcher, and we love that for fantasy. I didn't immediately love the landing spot for Gibbs, but Detroit has now officially traded D'Andre Swift, 
                clearing the path forward for Gibbs to take that 3rd down role.<br><br>
                I still expect David Montgomery to lead the team in carries by a good amount, but Gibbs is in a good offense and should catch a ton of passes. I like him 
                at #2 in dynasty unless it's SuperFlex.<br><br>
                <b>#3 - Jordan Addison (WR)</b> - Minnesota Vikings<br>
                Some say that the key to fantasy brilliance is the combination of talent and opportunity. Jordan Addison comes in at #3 with an amazing opportunity and 
                a ton of talent. Reeling in over 1600 yards and 18 touchdowns at Pitt in 2021, Addison is a star separator and has excellent hands. With Justin Jefferson 
                drawing all the attention in the back of opposing defenses, Addison will be left to work the middle of the field in a pass-happy offense. He's a little 
                undersized for what the NFL usually likes in wide receivers, but it's never been an issue for him in the past.<br><br>
                <b>#4 - Anthony Richardson (QB)</b> - Indianapolis Colts<br>
                Anthony Richardson set the world on fire when he broke almost every record that existed at the NFL Combine, and it caught the attention of NFL scouts 
                and general managers. As the first quarterback on my top 10 list, I believe Richardson represents immense upside. Accuracy was an issue when he 
                played at Florida, completing just 53.8% of his passes. However, his upside is in his rushing prowess. He averaged 54.5 rushing yards per game in 2022, 
                and I think that's the floor in the NFL. The new coach of the Colts, Shane Steichen, developed Jalen Hurts from a possible roster cut to a MVP candidate. 
                I think he can do the same with Richardson, the most athletic QB ever tested at the Combine.<br><br>
                <b>#5 - Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)</b> - Seattle Seahawks<br>
                Jaxon Smith-Njigba was widely regarded as the best wide receiver in this year's draft, and the Seahawks agreed, drafting him at #20 overall. He'll be 
                joining DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett in what should be one of the best wide receiver corps in the league. Smith-Njigba had a dominant 2021 season at 
                Ohio State while sharing the field with Chris Olave and Garrett Wilson. So, it's possible for him to demand targets even while sharing the field with 
                top tier talent.<br><br>
                My only concern with Smith-Njigba is the pass volume in the offense. With Zach Charbonnet also going to Seattle, I feel like Pete Carroll will want 
                to fall back into a run-heavy scheme. Geno Smith proved that he's still a quality quarterback, but without consistent volume, it will hard for Smith-Njigba 
                to put a dominant season together. I like him a lot more in dynasty than redraft.<br><br>
                <b>#6 - Devon Achane (RB)</b> - Miami Dolphins<br>
                Going at pick #84, the Dolphins grab a speedy running back to join Jeff Wilson and Raheem Mostert. Achane is a competent route runner and has homerun 
                speed, running the 40 yard dash in 4.32 seconds. It was clear heading into the draft that the Dolphins needed help at running back, and it was a surprise 
                to many that they didn't take one sooner. However, I really love the pick, and I believe Achane can be a solid fantasy contributor this year.<br><br>
                Oftentimes, the problem with running backs drafted past round 2 is that they can always get replaced. But, I think Achane is a good fit for McDaniel's 
                offense, and there's significant injury concerns with Wilson and Mostert. That could put Achane in the driver's seat in an offense that puts up a lot 
                of points.<br><br>
                <b>#7 - Bryce Young (QB)</b> - Carolina Panthers<br>
                The #1 pick in the 2023 NFL Draft finally finds a spot on this list. Bryce Young was over 64% in completion percentage each of the last 2 years at 
                Alabama, and he threw 47 touchdowns in one of those seasons in 15 games. He's a surgical passer and a winner wherever he goes. He's the most stable quarterback 
                in this draft class, and that's exactly what Carolina needs. Size may be a slight concern once he has NFL pass rushers breathing down his neck.<br><br>
                <b>#8 - Quentin Johnston (WR)</b> - Los Angeles Chargers<br>
                The big bodied Quentin Johnston lands in a great spot after getting drafted right after Smith-Njigba at pick #21. With Keenan Allen in the final moments 
                of his career, it was expected that the Chargers would make a move at wide receiver for Justin Herbert to throw to. However, I think Johnston is closer to a 
                Mike Williams archetype than a Keenan Allen. Mike Williams will be in a contract year after this season, so they may just be anticipating cutting him. Johnston 
                will have a premier quarterback throwing him the ball, and he should be a solid downfield threat and contested catch specialist.<br><br>
                <b>#9 - Zay Flowers (WR)</b> - Baltimore Ravens<br>
                Right after signing their star quarterback Lamar Jackson to a 5 year extension, the Ravens draft a promising weapon for him. Zay Flowers has a great 
                path for leading all Ravens wide receivers in targets. There is little competition for him to overcome, and I expect him to have a significant target share. 
                But, let's not forget that this will be a low passing offense, so it's hard to get too excited for Flowers. He did have 78 receptions, 1077 receiving yards, and 
                12 touchdowns in his last season at Boston College. He's a very appealing dynasty asset moving forward.<br><br>
                <b>#10 - Zach Charbonnet (RB)</b> - Seattle Seahawks<br>
                3 days ago, I fully expected to have Charbonnet as my 4th best fantasy option in this year's draft class. However, Charbonnet finds himself possibly in the 
                worst landing spot imaginable. After such an impressive rookie season, Kenneth Walker III looked like a complete lock as the bellcow running back in Seattle. 
                With such a prominent incoming rookie joining that backfield, both Walker and Charbonnet's outlook and upside is hurt by this pick.<br><br>
                It's not all doom and gloom for Charbonnet. He caught 37 passes in his last year at UCLA for 321 yards, and I expect him to be on the field for a large 
                percentage of 3rd downs for the Seahawks. That was not a part of Walker's usage at all, so it will be easy for Charbonnet to slot into that receiving role.<br><br>
