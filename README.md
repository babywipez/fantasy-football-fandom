# Fantasy Football Fandom

Fantasy Football Fandom is a website I created as my final project for
my Web Authoring 2 class at Santa Fe College.

For this project, I was unable to use any JavaScript or frameworks outside
of a mobile menu called Slicknav. Other than that, everything had to be done
with vanilla HTML and CSS.

This was one of the first multi-page websites I created, and overall, I am
mostly pleased with the design, especially the header, footer, and the hero-like
component on the home page.

This site was made in 2023 right after the NFL draft, and I wrote an in-depth
article about incoming rookies to the NFL. I think I did a fairly good job
predicting their value and production!
